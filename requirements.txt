# FastRenamer Requirements
# This file lists the dependencies for the FastRenamer application

# Python built-in libraries (included with standard Python distributions)
# tkinter - GUI framework for the application interface
# os - Operating system interface for file operations
# pathlib - Object-oriented filesystem paths
# messagebox - Dialog boxes for user feedback

# Note: This application primarily uses Python's built-in standard library.
# Tkinter is included with most Python installations, but if you encounter
# import errors for tkinter, you may need to install it separately:
# 
# On Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install python3-tk
# On CentOS/RHEL: sudo yum install tkinter
# On macOS with Homebrew: brew install python-tk
# 
# No additional pip packages are required for basic functionality.
